          <p> Anna Momigliano explains, “Muslim organizations agreed to create a registry of their imams and to require them to preach in Italian. In return, the government vowed to “facilitate the path” toward the official recognition of Islam in Italy.”(“In Italy, Islam doesn’t officially exist. Here’s what Muslims must accept to change that.”) Momigliano's analysis highlights the negotiation between Muslim organizations and the government, where compliance with state requirements is exchanged for promises of recognition. This dynamic underscores the government's attempt to exert control over religious expression and mandating Italian as the imam's language to prevent any secrecy among Islamic institutions, further demonstrating the Italian government's suspicion around any and all Muslim activity.</p>

      <p>Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano announced that, "The financial guards created a unit that specializes in monitoring the financial transactions coming from Islamic countries. This decision was made in parallel with the orders that I gave to monitor jihadist activities in Italy, according to the recommendations made by the committee of strategic analysis for the fight against terrorism"(“Italy: Islamic Institutions Under Surveillance”). Minister Alfano's announcement indicates his intent to monitor financial transactions from Islamic countries, aligning with efforts to combat jihadist activities. However, this surveillance overlooks the religious obligation of charity in Islam, choosing instead to view financial contributions with suspicion and necessitating monitoring. This approach not only undermines the religious freedom of Muslims but also perpetuates discrimination and suspicion within Italian society. "The Islamic cultural centers in Italy are financed by Saudi Arabia where Sharia is in force. In Europe there is a very Islamization process distant from the values of our civilization" said Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni (“No place for Islamic culture in Europe, says Italy's Giorgia Meloni at far right event”). The aforementioned statements reveal that it isn’t only a select few that hold these stereotypical views on Islam but these feelings are held by those in the highest office. Instead  of Italian officials promoting unity they're creating division. This us vs them dynamic leaves Italian Muslims under the designation of second class citizens. </p>
